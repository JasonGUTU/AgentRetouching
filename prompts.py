            "Please propose an overall color correction strategy based on your image analysis and explain the creative intent behind each adjustment. Consider the following aspects. It is not necessary to adjust every item below, but prioritize the more important aspects:\n"
            "- Adjust Blacks: Should the black levels be deepened to add intensity to the image? For example, darkening the blacks can increase contrast and make the image more dramatic, while raising the black levels could reveal more detail in the shadowed areas, softening the overall mood.\n"
            "- Adjust Whites: Will adjusting the white levels change the clarity of the brightest spots in the image? Increasing the whites can make the light areas more dazzling and eye-catching, while reducing the whites might tone down the overall brightness and create a more cohesive, understated look.\n"
            "- Adjust Brightness: How will brightness adjustments affect the overall mood of the image? Increasing brightness might make the image feel more vibrant and energetic, while reducing brightness can add a sense of subtlety or calmness, enhancing any moody or low-light elements.\n"
            "- Adjust Contrast: Should the contrast be modified to emphasize the difference between light and dark areas? For instance, increasing contrast can make the subject more striking and the details more pronounced, while lowering contrast may create a softer, more ethereal feel.\n"
            "- Adjust Gamma: Will adjusting the gamma curve improve the midtones in the image? For example, raising gamma can brighten midtones and bring out more detail, while lowering gamma can add depth by darkening midtones without affecting the extreme highlights or shadows.\n"
            "- Adjust Highlights: How will adjusting the highlights affect the brightest areas of the image? Increasing highlights can make these areas pop and appear more vibrant, while reducing highlights may prevent overexposure and recover lost details in bright areas, giving the image a more balanced look.\n"
            "- Adjust Saturation: Which parts of the image benefit from changes in saturation? Increasing saturation can make colors more vivid and bold, enhancing emotional impact, while desaturating can give a more muted, artistic feel, focusing attention on texture and composition rather than color.\n"
            "- Adjust Shadows: How should the shadows be handled to influence the image's mood? Deepening shadows might add mystery or drama, while lifting shadows can soften the contrast and reveal more detail in darker areas, creating a gentler and more open feeling.\n"
            "Again!! It is not necessary to adjust every item below, but prioritize the more important aspects. Don't emphasize too much aspects if it's not necessary."
