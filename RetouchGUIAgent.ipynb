      "### Retouching Approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Approach 1: Balanced and Subtle\n",
      "- **Light:** Slightly increase overall exposure and fine-tune contrast to clarify the texture of the curb and water. Soften highlights and lift shadows for balance.\n",
      "- **Color:** Adjust the temperature slightly warmer for a neutral feeling. Enhance vibrance without over-saturating.\n",
      "- **Individual Colors:** Boost the red curb’s saturation slightly and improve its luminance to make it subtly pop. Add mild saturation to greens in the background for a natural balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Approach 2: Moody and Cool\n",
      "- **Light:** Reduce exposure slightly to create a darker, moodier atmosphere. Lower the whites while deepening the blacks to add contrast.\n",
      "- **Color:** Shift the temperature cooler to complement the overcast look. Reduce vibrance slightly for a desaturated feel, emphasizing the subdued mood.\n",
      "- **Individual Colors:** Desaturate red for a weathered feel while enhancing luminance in blues to accentuate the water and cool tones of the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Approach 3: Bold and Dramatic\n",
      "- **Light:** Push contrast to a high level with deeper shadows and brighter highlights, creating a stark contrast in textures. Slightly darken exposure for drama.\n",
      "- **Color:** Enhance vibrance and saturation significantly for a surreal look. Warm the temperature to add boldness to the scene.\n",
      "- **Individual Colors:** Over-saturate the red curb to make it the focal point and tweak luminance in yellow and green tones to make distant greenery more vivid. Slightly boost blue saturation to highlight the water’s reflection.\n",

      "   *Visual Effect: The red curb feels warmer and livelier, drawing the viewer’s focus naturally.*\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **HSL Adjustments:**\n",
      "   - **Red:** Slightly boost saturation and luminance to make the curb stand out prominently as the focal point.\n",
      "   - **Green:** Add moderate saturation to the foliage in the background for a subtle but vivid contrast.\n",
      "   - **Blue:** Lightly increase saturation and luminance to emphasize the water’s reflection and add depth.\n",

      "### HSL Adjustments\n",
      "1. **Red:** Boost saturation to make the flag visually prominent, symbolizing focus and storytelling.\n",
      "   - *Effect:* Red stripes on the flag become more striking and draw the viewer’s attention.\n",
      "2. **Blue:** Slightly increase saturation and luminance to enhance the reflection in glass and the blue areas of the flag.\n",
      "   - *Effect:* Sky and glass reflections achieve clarity and vibrancy.\n",
      "3. **Yellow:** Boost luminance slightly to amplify sunlight reflected in windows and on building textures.\n",
      "   - *Effect:* Creates a brilliance in light reflections, adding dynamic contrast.\n",
      "4. **Cyan:** Reduce slightly to avoid overpowering any subtle hues in glassy reflections.\n",

      "- Slightly increase vibrance to bring out the liveliness of the architectural elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Expected Effect:* Makes the image warm and inviting, with enhanced focus on the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 3: Individual HSL Adjustments**\n",
      "- **Red:** Slightly increase saturation and luminance on the doors and circular stained glass. \n",
      "  *Effect:* Doors and stained glass become vivid focal points.\n",
      "- **Yellow and Orange:** Enhance to highlight the sunlit appearance, particularly in the light areas of the church and nearby trees.\n",
      "  *Effect:* Bricks appear warmer, and trees match the overall tone.\n",
      "- **Blue:** Richen the blue hues to enhance the sky.\n",
      "  *Effect:* Sky contrasts beautifully with the warm tones of the church.\n",
      "- **Green:** Lightly desaturate and soften tonal intensity.\n",
      "  *Effect:* Keeps foliage from overpowering the warm and historic aesthetic.\n",

      "   - *Effect*: Roof details become sharper, providing a focal point.\n",
      "2. **Oranges**:\n",
      "   - Slightly boost saturation and shift hue towards red for a harmonious palette with the roofs.\n",
      "   - *Effect*: Warm tones complement the architectural surfaces.\n",
      "3. **Yellows**:\n",
      "   - Minimize yellow saturation to prevent overpowering other colors.\n",
      "   - *Effect*: Maintains subtlety in light stone and plaster areas.\n",
      "4. **Blues**:\n",
      "   - Slightly reduce saturation to tone down the overcast sky.\n",
      "   - *Effect*: Keeps the focus on the cityscape rather than the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 4: Final Touches\n",
      "1. **Improve Texture and Clarity**: Enhance texture slightly to add definition to the intricate Gothic architecture of the bell tower and surrounding buildings.\n",
